###### Developed and implemented data analysis techniques to improve educational outcomes and user experience.
•Association Rule Mining: Applied the Apriori algorithm to identify patterns in students' incorrect answers. Calculated the probability of related questions being answered incorrectly based on their past performance and assessed the difficulty levels of questions (ranging from 0 to 1). Mapped questions to corresponding lessons or curriculum chapters.
•﻿Sentiment Analysis: Conducted sentiment analysis on course reviews to evaluate student satisfaction. Applied VADER sentiment analysis after preprocessing text reviews, including cleaning, stop word removal, and lemmatization, to identify the most and least favored courses by students.
